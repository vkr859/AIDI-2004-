Logistic Regression Model for Breast Cancer Diagnosis:
This repository contains a machine learning model built using Logistic Regression for the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. The goal of this model is to predict whether a breast cancer diagnosis is benign or malignant based on various features extracted from medical images.

Dataset:
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset consists of 569 samples, each with 30 numerical features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates of breast masses. The dataset includes a diagnosis column indicating the class label: benign (B) or malignant (M).

Model Description:
The Logistic Regression model is a widely used classification algorithm for binary classification tasks. It models the relationship between the input features and the probability of belonging to a certain class using a logistic function. In this case, the model predicts whether a breast cancer diagnosis is benign (0) or malignant (1) based on the provided features.

Usage:
To use the model, you can follow the provided Jupyter Notebook. It includes steps to load and preprocess the data, build the Logistic Regression model, and evaluate its performance using accuracy and a confusion matrix. Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to explore different aspects of the dataset or improve the model's performance.

Dependencies:
The implementation uses the following Python libraries:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
Make sure to install the necessary dependencies before running the code.
