Random Forest Model for Breast Cancer Diagnosis:
This repository contains a machine learning model built using Random Forest for the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. The purpose of this model is to predict whether a breast cancer diagnosis is benign or malignant based on various features extracted from medical images.

Dataset:
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset comprises 569 samples, each containing 30 numerical features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates of breast masses. The dataset includes a diagnosis column indicating the class label: benign (B) or malignant (M).

Model Description:
The Random Forest model is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. It constructs a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes predicted by individual trees. In this case, the model predicts whether a breast cancer diagnosis is benign (0) or malignant (1) based on the provided features.

Usage:
To use the model, refer to the provided Jupyter Notebook. It contains the necessary steps to load and preprocess the data, build the Random Forest model, and evaluate its performance using accuracy and a confusion matrix. Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to explore different aspects of the dataset or enhance the model's performance.

Dependencies:
The implementation relies on the following Python libraries:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
Ensure that you have installed the required dependencies before running the code.
